## Task 2: CI/CD Video

For this task, please include your answers for the questions described in the [Quiz 6](Q6.md) file below:

### Q1

CI is the development practice/process where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run

### Q2

CD is a process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment

### Q3

1 - Shorter review time. With continuous integration, developers can commit their codes frequently, which result in the team can review and be on the same page easier and the process of integrating changes will be faster

2 - Better code quality. Automating tests ensures the app/program perfrom consistently, making the results more reliable

3 - Faster bug fixes. When developers committing changes regularly, each release to production will contain a relatively small number of code changes, making it much easier to identify the cause of an issue.

### Q4

Jenkins
CircleCI
TeamCity
Bamboo
GitLab
Buddy
